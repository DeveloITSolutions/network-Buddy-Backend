# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes the foundational structure and generic components for a FastAPI application following clean architecture principles, SOLID design patterns, and DRY methodology. The goal is to create reusable, maintainable code that can serve as the base for any FastAPI project with minimal modifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured FastAPI application foundation, so that I can build scalable applications following best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize with proper configuration management
2. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL support environment-based settings (development, staging, production)
3. WHEN the API is accessed THEN the system SHALL respond with proper CORS, middleware, and error handling
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and proper session management

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want generic base classes and interfaces, so that I can implement domain-specific logic without repeating common patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new models THEN the system SHALL provide base model classes with common fields (id, created_at, updated_at)
2. WHEN implementing repositories THEN the system SHALL provide generic CRUD operations through base repository interface
3. WHEN creating services THEN the system SHALL provide base service class with common functionality
4. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL provide reusable Pydantic schemas with common validation patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency injection setup, so that I can easily manage dependencies and enable testability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL configure dependency injection container
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL inject required dependencies (database, services, repositories)
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL allow easy mocking of dependencies
4. WHEN adding new dependencies THEN the system SHALL follow consistent injection patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues effectively and provide meaningful error responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors with proper context and stack traces
2. WHEN API errors happen THEN the system SHALL return consistent error response format
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed validation error messages
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle connection issues gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database integration with migrations, so that I can manage database schema changes systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to database using SQLAlchemy
2. WHEN schema changes are needed THEN the system SHALL support Alembic migrations
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use proper transaction management
4. WHEN running in different environments THEN the system SHALL use appropriate database configurations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API documentation and health checks, so that I can monitor the application and provide clear API documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
2. WHEN health checks are requested THEN the system SHALL return application and database health status
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL include proper request/response examples in documentation
4. WHEN monitoring the application THEN the system SHALL provide metrics endpoints
