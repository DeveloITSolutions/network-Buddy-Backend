# The Plugs - Database Schema Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the database schema for **The Plugs** enterprise networking platform. The schema is designed to support multi-tenant architecture with complete data isolation between organizations.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Complete data isolation using `organization_id`
2. **Soft Delete Pattern**: All entities support soft deletion for data recovery
3. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive tracking of who created/modified records
4. **UUID Primary Keys**: Enterprise-grade unique identifiers
5. **Timestamp Tracking**: Automatic creation and update timestamps
6. **Relationship Integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints and cascading rules

## Entity Relationship Overview

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Platform users with authentication and profile data
- **Organizations**: Multi-tenant containers for data isolation
- **Contacts**: Professional networking contacts (targets/plugs)
- **Events**: Event management with full lifecycle support
- **Media**: File and media management system
- **Expenses**: Financial tracking for events and activities
- **Notifications**: Real-time communication system

### Supporting Entities
- **Contact Interactions**: Tracking networking activities
- **Event Attendees**: Event participation management
- **Event Agenda Items**: Detailed event scheduling
- **Media Collections**: Organized media groupings
- **Integration Logs**: Third-party system synchronization
- **Analytics**: Platform usage and performance metrics

## Business Rules

### Authentication & Authorization
- Users must belong to an organization
- Email verification required for account activation
- Role-based access control within organizations
- Multi-factor authentication support

### Networking & Contacts
- Contacts are organization-scoped (multi-tenant)
- Contact status flow: Target → Contact → Plug
- Interaction tracking for relationship building
- Lead scoring and priority management

### Event Management
- Events support complex agenda management
- Attendee registration and check-in tracking
- Financial tracking per event
- Media association for documentation

### Media & Content
- Secure file storage with access controls
- Media can be associated with events, contacts, or standalone
- Support for various media types (images, videos, documents)
- Automatic thumbnail generation for images

### Financial Management
- Expense tracking linked to events and users
- Category-based expense classification
- Approval workflow for expense management
- Financial reporting and analytics

## Data Privacy & Security

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
- All user data is isolated by `organization_id`
- Row-level security enforced at application layer
- No cross-tenant data access possible

### Audit & Compliance
- Complete audit trail for all data modifications
- Soft delete for data recovery requirements
- GDPR compliance with data export capabilities
- SOC 2 Type II compliance ready

### Data Encryption
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- PII fields use application-level encryption
- Secure file storage with access controls

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategy
- Composite indexes on `(organization_id, created_at)`
- Search indexes on frequently queried text fields
- Foreign key indexes for relationship performance

### Scaling Considerations
- Horizontal sharding by organization possible
- Read replicas for analytics workloads
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data

## Integration Points

### External Systems
- HubSpot CRM synchronization
- Email service providers
- File storage services (S3, etc.)
- Analytics platforms

### API Design
- RESTful APIs with proper resource modeling
- GraphQL support for complex queries
- Webhook endpoints for real-time integrations
